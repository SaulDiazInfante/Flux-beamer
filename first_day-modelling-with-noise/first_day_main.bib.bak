  abstract = {The role of stochasticity and its interplay with nonlinearity are central current issues in studies of the complex population patterns observed in nature, including the pronounced oscillations of wildlife and infectious diseases. The dynamics of childhood diseases have provided influential case studies to develop and test mathematical models with practical application to epidemiology, but are also of general relevance to the central question of whether simple nonlinear systems can explain and predict the complex temporal and spatial patterns observed in nature outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a stochastic theory for the major dynamical transitions in epidemics from regular to irregular cycles, which relies on the discrete nature of disease transmission and low spatial coupling. The full spectrum of stochastic fluctuations is derived analytically to show how the amplification of noise varies across these transitions. The changes in noise amplification and coherence appear robust to seasonal forcing, questioning the role of seasonality and its interplay with deterministic components of epidemiological models. Childhood diseases are shown to fall into regions of parameter space of high noise amplification. This type of "endogenous" stochastic resonance may be relevant to population oscillations in nonlinear ecological systems in general.},

Although a.s. positivity in an approximation is impossible to achieve, we develop for the strong (Maruyama) approximation an asymptotic estimate of the number of mesh points required for positivity as our tolerance of non-positive trajectories tends to zero, and examine the effectiveness of this estimate in the context of practical numerical simulation. We show how this analysis generalises to equations with a drift coefficient that may display a high level of nonlinearity, but which must be linearly bounded from below (i.e. when acting towards zero), and a linearly bounded diffusion coefficient. Finally, in the linear case we develop a refined asymptotic estimate that is more useful as an a priori guide to the number of mesh points required to produce positive approximations with a given probability. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In the case of real noise the class of noise processes that permit a stationary solution is characterized by their spectral density. It turns out that this class consists of all stationary processes that do not contain the eigenfrequencies of the LOTKA-VOLTERRA system.It is shown that for all other real noise processes a resonance phenomenon occurs and the solutions grow unboundedly.},

  abstract = {Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces the viral burden in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected patients below the threshold of detectability. However, substantial evidence indicates that viral replication persists in these individuals. In this paper we examine the ability of several biologically motivated models of HIV-1 dynamics to explain sustained low viral loads. At or near drug efficacies that result in steady state viral loads below detectability, most models are extremely sensitive to small changes in drug efficacy. We argue that if these models reflect reality many patients should have cleared the virus, contrary to observation. We find that a model in which the infected cell death rate is dependent on the infected cell density does not suffer this shortcoming. The shortcoming is also overcome in two more conventional models that include small populations of cells in which the drug is less effective than in the main population, suggesting that difficulties with drug penetrance and maintenance of effective intracellular drug concentrations in all cells susceptible to HIV infection may underlie ongoing viral replication.},

  abstract  = {Kinetic theory is a mathematical framework intended to relate directly the most relevant characteristics of the molecular structure to the rheological behavior of the bulk system. In other words, kinetic theory is a micro-to-macro approach for solving the flow of complex fluids that circumvents the use of closure relations and offers a better physical description of the phenomena involved in the flow processes. Cornerstone models in kinetic theory employ beads, rods and springs for mimicking the molecular structure of the complex fluid. The generalized bead-rod-spring chain includes the most basic models in kinetic theory: the freely jointed bead-spring chain and the freely-jointed bead-rod chain. Configuration of simple coarse-grained models can be represented by an equivalent Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of the configuration distribution function in the physical and configurational spaces. FP equation can be a complex mathematical object, given its multidimensionality, and solving it explicitly can become a difficult task. Even more, in some cases, obtaining an equivalent FP equation is not possible given the complexity of the coarse-grained molecular model. Brownian dynamics can be employed as an alternative extensive numerical method for approaching the configuration distribution function of a given kinetic-theory model that avoid obtaining and/or resolving explicitly an equivalent FP equation. The validity of this discrete approach is based on the mathematical equivalence between a continuous diffusion equation and a stochastic differential equation as demonstrated by It\^{o} in the 1940s. This paper presents a review of the fundamental issues in the BD simulation of the linear viscoelastic behavior of bead-rod-spring coarse grained models in dilute solution. In the first part of this work, the BD numerical technique is introduced. An overview of the mathematical framework of the BD and a review of the scope of applications are presented. Subsequently, the links between the rheology of complex fluids, the kinetic theory and the BD technique are established at the light of the stochastic nature of the bead-rod-spring models. Finally, the pertinence of the present state-of-the-art review is explained in terms of the increasing interest for the stochastic micro-to-macro approaches for solving complex fluids problems. In the second part of this paper, a detailed description of the BD algorithm used for simulating a small-amplitude oscillatory deformation test is given. Dynamic properties are employed throughout this work to characterise the linear viscoelastic behavior of bead-rod-spring models in dilute solution. In the third and fourth part of this article, an extensive discussion about the main issues of a BD simulation in linear viscoelasticity of diluted suspensions is tackled at the light of the classical multi-bead-spring chain model and the multi-bead-rod chain model, respectively. Kinematic formulations, integration schemes and expressions to calculate the stress tensor are revised for several classical models: Rouse and Zimm theories in the case of multi-bead-spring chains, and Kramers chain and semi-flexible filaments in the case of multi-bead-rod chains. The implemented BD technique is, on the one hand, validated in front of the analytical or exact numerical solutions known of the equivalent FP equations for those classic kinetic theory models; and, on the other hand, is control-set thanks to the analysis of the main numerical issues involved in a BD simulation. Finally, the review paper is closed by some concluding remarks.},

The formally exact expression for the Laplace-transformed quantum propagator averaged over the stationary realizations of such N -state non-Markovian noise is obtained. The theory possesses a wide range of applications. It includes some previous Markovian and non-Markovian theories as particular cases. In the context of the stochastic theory of spectral line shape and relaxation, the developed approach presents a non-Markovian generalization of the Kubo-Anderson theory of sudden modulation. In particular, the exact analytical expression is derived for the spectral line shape of optical transitions described by a Kubo oscillator with randomly modulated frequency which undergoes jumplike non-Markovian fluctuations in time.},

The concept of numerical stability of deterministic schemes is extended to the stochastic case, and a stochastic analogue of Dahlquist's A-stability is proposed. It is shown that the discretization of the drift term alone controls the A-stability of the whole scheme. The quantitative effect of implicitness upon A-stability is also investigated, and stability regions are given for a family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods with optimal order of convergence.},

The result concerns mean-square stability on a stochastic differential equation test problem with multiplicative noise. The numerical method reduces to the Theta Method on deterministic problems. Saito and Mitsui showed that the deterministic A-stability property of the Theta Method does not carry through to the mean-square context in general, and gave a condition un- der which unconditional stability holds. The main purpose of this note is to emphasize that the approach of Saito and Mitsui makes it possible to quantify precisely the point where unconditional stability is lost in terms of the ratio of the drift (deterministic) and diffusion (stochastic) coefficients. This leads to a concept akin to deterministic A($\alpha$)-stability that may be useful in the stability analysis of more general methods. It is also shown that mean-square A-stability is recovered if the Theta Method parameter is increased beyond its normal range to the value 3/2.},

  abstract = {Stability analysis of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is motivated by the question ``for what choices of stepsize does the numerical method reproduce the characteristics of the test equation? '' We study a linear test equation with a multiplicative noise term, and consider mean-square and asymptotic stability of a stochastic version of the theta method. We extend some mean-square stability results in [Saito and Mitsui, SIAM. J. Numer. Anal., 33 (1996), pp. 2254--2267]. In particular, we show that an extension of the deterministic A-stability property holds. We also plot mean-square stability regions for the case where the test equation has real parameters. For asymptotic stability, we show that the issue reduces to finding the expected value of a parametrized random variable. We combine analytical and numerical techniques to get insights into the stability properties. For a variant of the method that has been proposed in the literature we obtain precise analytic expressions for the asymptotic stability region. This allows us to prove a number of results. The technique introduced is widely applicable, and we use it to show that a fully implicit method suggested by [Kloeden and Platen, Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations, Springer-Verlag, 1992] has an asymptotic stability extension of the deterministic A-stability property. We also use the approach to explain some numerical results},

Recent results extend this convergence to coefficients that grow, at most, linearly. For superlinearly growing coefficients, finite-time convergence in the strong mean-square sense remains. In this article, we answer this question to the negative and prove, for a large class of SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, that Euler{\textquoteright}s approximation converges neither in the strong mean-square sense nor in the numerically weak sense to the exact solution at a finite time point. Even worse, the difference of the exact solution and of the numerical approximation at a finite time point diverges to infinity in the strong mean-square sense and in the numerically weak sense.},

  abstract      = {The understanding of adaptive algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is an open area, where many issues related to both convergence and stability (long-time behaviour) of algorithms are unresolved. This paper considers a very simple adaptive algorithm, based on controlling only the drift component of a time step. Both convergence and stability are studied. The primary issue in the convergence analysis is that the adaptive method does not necessarily drive the time steps to zero with the user-input tolerance. This possibility must be quantified and shown to have low probability. The primary issue in the stability analysis is ergodicity. It is assumed that the noise is nondegenerate, so that the diffusion process is elliptic, and the drift is assumed to satisfy a coercivity condition. The SDE is then geometrically ergodic (averages converge to statistical equilibrium exponentially quickly). If the drift is not linearly bounded, then explicit fixed time step approximations, such as the Euler-Maruyama scheme, may fail to be ergodic. In this work, it is shown that the simple adaptive time-stepping strategy cures this problem. In addition to proving ergodicity, an exponential moment bound is also proved, generalizing a result known to hold for the SDE itself.},

The existing known results have only so far shown that the classical (explicit) Euler-Maruyama (EM) approximate solutions converge to the true solution in probability [22,23]. More recently, the authors in [16] proved that the classical EM method will diverge in L2 sense for the underlying SDEs in this paper (and those SDEs with superlinearly growing coefficients). These strongly indicate that the classical EM method is not good enough for the highly nonlinear SDEs. However, in this paper, we introduce a modified EM method using stopping time and show successfully that the discrete version of the modified EM approximate solution converges to the true solution in the strong sense (namely in L2) with a order arbitrarily close to a half. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The stochastic version of this process appears to have far more intriguing properties than its deterministic counterpart. Indeed, the fact that a potential deterministic population explosion can be prevented by the presence of even a tiny amount of environmental noise shows the high level of difference which exists between these two representations. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

On the basis of such an approach, for one-dimensional and multidimensional semi- linear transport equations of quite a general form with given initial data and boundary conditions the exact difference schemes (EDSs) are constructed. In the case of constant coefficients, such numerical methods can be created on rectangular grids, while in the case of variable coefficients -- on moving grids only. The questions of developing differ- ence schemes of arbitrary order for quasi-linear transport equations with a nonlinear right-hand side are discussed. In this paper, the EDSs are constructed also for certain classes of linear and quasi- linear parabolic equations, for convection-diffusion problems with a small parameter, as well as inhomogeneous wave equations with constant coefficient},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling combined with experimental measurements have yielded important insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis. For example, data from experiments in which HIV-infected patients are given potent antiretroviral drugs that perturb the infection process have been used to estimate kinetic parameters underlying HIV infection. Many of the models used to analyze data have assumed drug treatments to be completely efficacious and that upon infection a cell instantly begins producing virus. We consider a model that allows for less then perfect drug effects and which includes a delay in the initiation of virus production. We present detailed analysis of this delay differential equation model and compare the results to a model without delay. Our analysis shows that when drug efficacy is less than 100\%, as may be the case in vivo, the predicted rate of decline in plasma virus concentration depends on three factors: the death rate of virus producing cells, the efficacy of therapy, and the length of the delay. Thus, previous estimates of infected cell loss rates can be improved upon by considering more realistic models of viral infection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.},

The effect of single drug therapy, however, is often only short-lived as the virus readily develops drug-resistant mutants. In this paper we provide analytic approximations for the rate of emergence of resistant virus. We study the decline of wildtype virus and the rise of resistant mutant virus in different compartments of the virus population such as free plasma virus, cells infected with actively replicating virus, long-lived infected cells and cells carrying defective provirus. The model results are compared with data on the rise of drug-resistant virus in three HIV-1 infected patients treated with neverapine (NVP). We find that the half-life of latently infected cells is between 10 and 20 days, whereas the half-life of cells with defective provirus is about 80 days. We also provide a crude estimate for the basic reproductive ratio of HIV-1 during NVP therapy.},

When the qualitative change of the stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is considered, the stochastic Hopf bifurcation appears as a change from a Dirac measure to a crater-like density. Unfortunately, this behavior is not related to the sample stability of the trivial solution zero. To capture all the stochastic dynamics of the equation, it is necessary to investigate the change of stability of invariant measures and the occurrence of new invariant measures for the generated random dynamical system.

It is proved that under the influence of telegraph noise, all positive trajectories of such a system always go out from any compact set of int R+ 2 with probability one if two rest points of the two systems do not coincide. In case where they have the rest point in common, the trajectory either leaves from any compact set of int R+ 2 or converges to the rest point. The escape of the trajectories from any compact set means that the system is neither permanent nor dissipative. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Recently, an explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme, called the tamed Euler method, is proposed in [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen, \& Kloeden (2010); Strong convergence of an explicit numerical method for SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, arXiv:1010.3756v1] for such SDEs. Motivated by their work, we here introduce a tamed version of the Milstein scheme for SDEs with commutative noise. The proposed method is also explicit and easily implementable. Moreover, it achieves higher strong order than the tamed Euler method. Note that new difficulties arise in recovering the strong convergence order one and new techniques are developed to overcome them. Finally, an illustrative example confirms the computational efficiency of this explicit numerical scheme compared to the tamed Euler method.},

This work proposes a semi-tamed Euler scheme, which is also explicit, to solve the SDEs with the drift coefficient equipped with the Lipschitz continuous part and non-Lipschitz continuous part. It is shown that the semi-tamed Euler converges strongly with the standard order one-half to the exact solution of the SDE. We also investigate the stability inheritance of the semi-tamed Euler schemes and reveal that this scheme does have advantage in reproducing the exponential mean square stability of the exact solution.

  abstract = {A recurrent problem in ecology and conservation
    biology is to estimate the risk of population extinctions. Extinction
    probabilities are not only imperative for conservation and management, but 
    may
    also elucidate basic mechanisms of the regulation of natural populations
    (Burgman et al. 1993; Pimm 1994). The usual way of modelling stochastic
    influence on population dynamics has been to assume that the external noise 
    is
    uncorrelated. This means that each and every randomly drawn noise value is
    totally independent on previous ones. This is what is generally called 
    `white'
    noise. However, the noise itself can be temporally autocorrelated. That is, 
    the
    values of the random numbers used in the noise process will depend on 
    previous
    ones. Here we show that the autocorrelation, or colour, of the external 
    noise
    assumed to influence population dynamics strongly modifies estimated 
    extinction
    probabilities. For positively autocorrelated (`red') noise, the risk of
    extinction clearly decreases the stronger the autocorrelation is. Negatively
    autocorrelated (`blue') noise is more ambiguously related to extinction
    probability. Thus, the commonly assumed white noise in population modelling 
    will
    severely bias population extinction risk estimates. Moreover, the extinction
    probability estimates are also significantly dependent on model structure 
    which
    calls for a cautious use of traditional discrete-time models.},

    disease models with multiple infectious groups. Branching process theory

  abstract = {Physiological bone remodeling is a highly coordinated process 
    responsible for bone resorption and formation and is necessary to repair 
    damaged 
    bone and to maintain mineral homeostasis. In addition to the traditional 
    bone 
    cells (osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes) that are necessary for 
    bone 
    remodeling, several immune cells have also been implicated in bone disease. 
    This 
    mini-review discusses physiological bone remodeling, outlining the 
    tra-ditional 
    bone biology dogma in light of emerging osteoimmunol-ogy data. Specifically 
    discussed in detail are the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone 
    remodeling, including events that orchestrate the five sequential phases of 
    bone 
    remodeling: activa-tion, resorption, reversal, formation, and termination. 
    Bone 
    is a dynamic tissue that undergoes continual adaption during vertebrate 
    life to 
    attain and preserve skeletal size, shape, and structural integrity and to 
    regulate mineral homeostasis. Two processes, remodeling and modeling, 
    underpin 
    develop-ment and maintenance of the skeletal system. Bone modeling is 
    responsible for growth and mechanically induced adaption of bone and 
    requires 
    that the processes of bone formation and bone removal (resorption), 
    although 
    globally coordinated, occur independently at distinct anatomical locations. 
    Bone 
    remodeling is responsible for removal and repair of damaged bone to 
    maintain 
    integrity of the adult skeleton and mineral homeostasis. This tightly 
    coordinated event requires the syn-chronized activities of multiple 
    cellular 
    participants to ensure that bone resorption and formation occur 
    sequentially at 
    the same anatomical location to preserve bone mass. This work will review 
    the 
    cellular participants and molecular mechanisms that coordinate the five 
    distinct 
    phases of bone remodeling and includes an appraisal of immune cells and 
    their 
    role in regulat-ing normal bone physiology.},
